This is a basic desktop cleanup program that I have started as my first Python project
It will be added to as I learn more of Python

For now, its operation is to iterate over the users desktop and grab any screenshots, image files and movie files and compile those files into a parent folder called 'Cleanup' and sub folders of 'screenshots' 'images' and 'movies'

It is scheduled to run once a week every Monday

It is scheduled to send the screenshots folder to the recycling bin once a week every monday
